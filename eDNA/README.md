Based on Debbie's protocol, the basic steps (following amplification with the control region primers) are to denoise/demultiplex with dada2 in qiime, with no filtering other than to trim primers. Debbie then does a blast search and extracts the top 5 hits, and pulls the cetaceans from that, as well as the humans/pigs/cow/mouse to see what those are doing.
