Possible boat damage on body?	Gross Pathology: This neonatal male calf was in good post mortem condition, with minimal skin sloughing but moderate scavenging of skin around the eyes and some tissue loss around the lower jaws. Maxillary and mandibular teeth were erupted, there were no foetal folds and no foetal whiskers. The calf was in poor body condition, with a prominent 'neck', easily palpable spinous processes, a low blubber depth and very poor muscle condition. There were multiple deep rake marks on both sides, as well as two lacerations, one on each flank. These lacerations affected the full thickness of skin, and surrounding skin was under-run. There was no evidence of bruising of either blubber or muscle, suggesting that this damage occurred after death. There were multiple 2-4mm diameter ulcers within the oesophageal mucosa and squamous portion of the stomach. The stomach contained only a scant amount of cloudy pink/cream fluid, and the intestines were empty. The lungs were well inflated, with a very small amount of foam adherent to the tracheal mucosa	Natural causes- maternal separation	DIAGNOSIS: Probable starvation due to maternal separation. Tissue samples have been collected to evaluate for underlying disease, and to more accurately determine if the lacerations on the flanks were caused before or after death. Even if these wounds were inflicted before death, they were mild and would not have been sufficient to cause death. The very poor body condition and lack of ingesta and intestinal contents suggest that this young calf has not been fed for at least several days.	46194	Maternal sep	maternal separation	n	NA	NA

Open cause of death; possible bycatch. 2. Mild/moderate alveolar/interstitial pneumonia with intralesional squames. This is a very young calf that has fed reently, indicating that maternal separation is not the likely primary cause of death. There are some unusual lesions in and around the calf's mouth that are indicative of trauma, and could be consistent with contact with fishing gear. Histology shows inflammation in the lungs (i.e. pneumonia), but unsure of clinical significance of this.	56791	Maternal sep	maternal separation + possible pneumonia	unknown	testing underway to evaluate cause of pneumonia	NA
