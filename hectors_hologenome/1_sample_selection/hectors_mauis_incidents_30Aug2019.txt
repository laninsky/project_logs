Maxillary and mandibular teeth were erupted, there were no foetal folds and no foetal whiskers. The calf was in poor body condition, with a prominent 'neck', easily palpable spinous processes, a low blubber depth and very poor muscle condition. There were multiple deep rake marks on both sides, as well as two lacerations, one on each flank. These lacerations affected the full thickness of skin, and surrounding skin was under-run. There was no evidence of bruising of either blubber or muscle, suggesting that this damage occurred after death. There were multiple 2-4mm diameter ulcers within the oesophageal mucosa and squamous portion of the stomach. The stomach contained only a scant amount of cloudy pink/cream fluid, and the intestines were empty. The lungs were well inflated, with a very small amount of foam adherent to the tracheal mucosa"	Land	Post mortem	DOC	P	Male	Juvenile	94	Sent for necropsy	Complete	Natural causes- maternal separation	"DIAGNOSIS: Probable starvation due to maternal separation.
